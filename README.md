##Overview

StaffHacker is a web application that allows hiring managers to rate and comment on 
recruiter they've worked with. In many ways, it's like a Yelp page for IT recruiting. 

The app allows users to log in and search recruiters by name or company. The user can
read all comments and ratings from previous users, as well as write their own comments and apply a rating.

StaffHacker is a Rails/AngularJS project created for the General Assembly Web Development Immersive program in Atlanta, GA.
